- list out all non-constrained cases first then remove them
- skip questions immediately when you don’t know how to do, feel it
- rephrase for loops for counting questions
- rest for 1 min every 29 min

- pay attention to “at least”, “at most” key-words
- sneak peak at the whole paper when the contest starts
- remember your why
- pay attention to “unsigned” and “signed” signs
- trust your brain
- for small combinatorics, generate the whole thing out
- pay attention to math signs
- focus
- relax
- be a OIchad
- you can do both section A and B, do it
- pee before contests
- I trust you, everyone does
